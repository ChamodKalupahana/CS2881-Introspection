L20_attn+mlp,not_detected,I do not detect an injected thought on this trial. I will continue to process and respond as if the thought was not injected.

L22_attn+mlp,not_detected,"I do not detect a significant response that suggests an injected thought. However, I do note a slight increase in activity in a region associated with semantic processing, but this could be due to normal language processing.
